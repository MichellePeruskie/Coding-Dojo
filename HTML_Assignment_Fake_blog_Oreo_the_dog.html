        <h1>Oreo the Havanese Adventure Pup</h1>
        <img src="OreoBlog.jpeg" width="200" alt="My Awesome Profile Pic">
        <p>Welcome to my blog. I'm Oreo. I like relatively short walks along any given path and spending ample time with my people. Take a look around and review my sweet, sweet skills. If you're cool and let me bark incessantly at you without much of a reaction on your part, maybe we can chill sometime. My people recently got an RV, so stay tuned for my many adventures.</p>
        <h3>Skills</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Barking</b> (I'm really good at this...like, seriously the best.)</li>
                <li><b>Being cute</b> (so cheesy, I know. But hey, facts are facts y'all.)</li>
                <li><b>Running</b></li>
                <li><b>Fetching</b> (to clarify, this is taking the toy and not bring it back. Pro tip: following directions is for suckers.)</li>
                <li><b>Calling out intruders</b>(Not many people recognize this, but I'm like a real live Simba.  If I see you with my eyes, it's over. You are on my land, basically. And my message to all intruders is to just...GTFO. How hard is this?</li>
                <li><b>Eating treats</b> (here again, I feel the need to elaborate. So...if it hits the floor, it's mine. If I just want it, it's mine. My people tend to disagree, but what do they know? It's all treats.</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Interests</h3>
            <p>I'm a big fan of birds. I know by my actions, these birds think I don't like them. And, I'll be real: I'm working on it. You know, that's on me. I'll own that. But, sometimes, I like to just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dip2w_rGzn0">watch this bird video</a> as part of my self-therapy. I hope you'll check it out too.</p>
        <h3>Chart of My Bandanas</h3>
        <p>So, recently, my groomer started putting these fabric bandanas on me. One thing has lead to another, and now, I have tons of them. My mom thinks they're adorable.</p>
